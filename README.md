Nothing lasts forever – even the insights from your last survey go stale after a while. One way to keep your survey results fresh and actionable is by running your survey again and creating a multi wave tracking study, also known as tracker or tracking survey. 

A tracking survey is a survey that asks the same questions across an interval of time, which allows you to “track” the changes from one deployment to the next and find trends over a certain period.

Each time you send your survey, whether it’s annually, quarterly, or more frequently is called a “wave.” Comparing survey results across waves will show trends and changing attitudes that can either prove your decisions are solid or indicate it’s time to change course.

## Problem Statements (Version 1)

Mr. Banku Yadav has just started with his NGO. During this Covid-19 pandemic, he decided to do a fundraiser to help the people in need. He found a slum nearby named Nayandahalli where he saw people who were in need of food and ration kits.

Before starting with the fundraiser he thought of exploring the slum and thereby conducted a survey. When Banku Yadav reached Nayandahalli he found out that there were a lot of people and collecting each and everyone’s record manually would become a tedious process. So he thought of creating an app that will make his task easier in conducting the survey. Banku Yadav is not a tech-savvy person to build a survey app.

It is your time to rise and shine as you have a golden opportunity to help Banku Yadav create an app for conducting his survey. Refer the sample input and output examples given below to create your app.
