# Contributing to CodeWithGirlscriptBangalore

## The following would remain the general workflow for issue allotement:

1. Issues will be created on GitHub.
2. The participant should comment on the issue he/she is interested to work on, mentioning the same.
3. One of our team members will assign the issue to the participant who commented. 
   (Please note that assignment will be on a first come first serve basis. One issue can be reserved by one participant at a time.)
4. Once the participant is assigned an issue, he/she will be given a deadline under which they need to create a PR which solves that issue.
5. If they fail to do the same, then the issue will be unassigned and we'll wait for someone else to take it up.
